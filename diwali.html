Most memorable Diwali experience<br><br>
The most memorable Diwali experience for me was three Years back. <br>On the night of Diwali, my mother was busy in making arrangements for the prayer and I and my younger brother were sent out to distribute in the neighborhood some boxes of sweets. Down a huge Neem tree, there was a small puppy shivering in cold. <br>I looked at my brother, he looked back at me and immediately he knew what I meant. We came back home, had more sweets and got scolding for being late again. The sweet small puppy we brought home got acceptance and mind it, this worked only because mother got convinced we must welcome all on the sacred day of Diwali.<br>
This is the third Diwali with Roli, our pet now, and she sits right next to me while I write this post on her on the occasion of Diwali.<br>
