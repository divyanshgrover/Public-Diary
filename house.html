<p class="x"<center>🏡 My New House 🏡</center></p>
<center><p class="y">I was ripped from the home I grew up in. It can be hard for kids to move. I think it was tough for me because I had to leave my friends, my safe place,
 and the home I grew up in.At the age of ten, I moved to a new house. It was disappointing because I had to leave the friends I grew up with behind. We would play together every day, but
 the day I told them I had to move, we all sulked around. My mom was in a very good mood, but every time she looked at me I couldn’t help but cry because I was leaving my friends behind.
The move to the new house was pretty scary. I didn’t know anyone around, and I felt like it wasn’t safe. My neighborhood is not the best. Since I have moved, there have been multiple 
break-ins and thefts around my house, including mine. I still get scared, which makes me feel like my old house was a safer place.I always thought that I would live in the place I grew
 up in until I was eighteen. It never happened, and I still don’t like the thought that I won’t see my mom grow old in that house. Although my memories are pleasant, they can still make
 me sad. My old home was the first and last spot I had seen my grandma which makes me miss her all the time. From my point of view, the new house can’t bring as many memories as the 
 one I grew up in.
